# Detection and Identification System

This is the model that identifies the pre-existing faces and marks the attendence of the face it captures the image.
For unknown face it gives option to save the image if we want it and after saving relevent iformation about the person captured in the frame.
It can identifiy the person onwards.
The encodings of the image is saved in pickel file to make model faster (it doesn't have to perform encodings eachtime the model loads)
